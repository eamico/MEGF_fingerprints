# MEG_fingerprints
Sample code to reproduce results of the manuscript *"Exploring MEG brain fingerprints: Evaluation, pitfalls, and interpretations"* by Sareen et al., NeuroImage 2021  , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118331. The code reproduces certain results from the manuscript. 

Run the main script: meg_id_icc.m. The code generates Fig.2 and Fig. 3  of the paper (only the Intra-class correlation matrices) for the alpha and beta bands, for 3 MEG Functional Connectivity measures (i.e., AECc, PLM, wPLI). More comment and details are provided within the main script. Also, some sample connectomes are included in the repo to make the code standalone.

Code Authors: Ekansh Sareen, Alessandra Griffa, Enrico Amico.
